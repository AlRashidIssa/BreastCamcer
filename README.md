# Breast Cancer Prediction Pipeline

This repository provides a comprehensive pipeline for processing breast cancer data, training a machine learning model, and evaluating predictions. The pipeline includes components for data ingestion, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. It also integrates with MLflow for experiment tracking and model management.

## Prerequisites

Before running the pipeline, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Virtualenv (for managing Python environments)
- [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) (for experiment tracking and model management)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (for running the API server)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-pipeline.git
    cd breast-cancer-pipeline
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up MLflow:**

    Make sure you have MLflow installed and running. You can start the MLflow server with:

    ```bash
    mlflow ui --port 8080
    ```

    By default, MLflow runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Update the `mlflow.set_tracking_uri()` in the code if your MLflow server is running on a different address.

## Usage

### Running the Pipeline

Execute the pipeline by running the `main.py` script. The script accepts the following command-line arguments:

- `--yaml_path`: Path to the YAML configuration file.
- `--analyzer`: Optional flag to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

To run the training process with EDA:

```bash
python main.py --yaml_path path/to/your/config.yaml --analyzer
```

To run the training process without EDA:

```bash
python main.py --yaml_path path/to/your/config.yaml
```

### Running the API Server

To start the Django API server, use the provided shell script:

```bash
./run.sh --train False
```

This will start the Django server for API operations.

### Shell Script Usage

The `run.sh` script manages both the training pipeline and the API server. It accepts the following arguments:

- `--yaml_path`: Path to the YAML configuration file (required if `--train` is `True`).
- `--analyzer`: Optional flag to perform EDA.
- `--train`: Set to `True` to run the training process or `False` to start the API server.
- `--mlflow`: Set to `True` to run the MLflow pipeline or `False` otherwise.

#### Position 1: Train Only

Run the script with training enabled and MLflow disabled:

```bash
./run.sh --yaml_path /path/to/your/config.yaml --analyzer True --train True --mlflow False
```

**Expected Behavior:**

- Activates the virtual environment.
- Runs `main.py` with `--yaml_path` and `--analyzer` arguments.
- Starts the Django API server on port 8000.

#### Position 2: MLflow Only

Run the script with MLflow enabled and training disabled:

```bash
./run.sh --train False --mlflow True
```

**Expected Behavior:**

- Activates the virtual environment.
- Displays a message that MLflow is configured but not started by this script.
- Starts the Django API server on port 8000.

#### Position 3: Train and MLflow

Run the script with both training and MLflow enabled:

```bash
./run.sh --yaml_path /path/to/your/config.yaml --analyzer True --train True --mlflow True
```

**Expected Behavior:**

- Activates the virtual environment.
- Starts MLflow server (as a separate action, not in this script).
- Runs `mlflow_pipeline.py` with `--yaml_path` argument.
- Starts the Django API server on port 8000.

#### Position 4: API Only

Run the script with neither training nor MLflow:

```bash
./run.sh --train False --mlflow False
```

**Expected Behavior:**

- Activates the virtual environment.
- Starts the Django API server on port 8000.
